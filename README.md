# 3.Calculator
This is a Calculator. It does calculations from basic to statistics.

This is my third project. In this project I expolered more of the mathematics side of python. I utilized modules and loops. Learning these modules will be a great help in the future projects.

The calculator is designed in a way where one enters numbers consecutively and then the numbers are put in a list.
In this calculator a letter is assigned to a certain function, entering that letter executes that certain function.
For example, the letter 'a' is assigned to sum all numbers in the list.
